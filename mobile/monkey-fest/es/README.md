# Prism + ReactiveUI a match made for mobile

## Abstract
Prism is a popular MVVM framework for .NET native developers and a great choice for Xamarin.Forms.  Prism will help guide you on MVVM better practices and separation of concerns. But, when developing a mobile application, there is no better tool than functional programming to manage mutable state.  During this session, we will look at how you can harness the power of ReactiveUI for MVVM state management in a Prism application.
