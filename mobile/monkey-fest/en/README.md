# Xamarin.Forms at scale

## Abstract
When writing a large-scale .NET application you have a lot of choices you have to make.  What am I going to use for a database?  Who am I going to use for a cloud provider?  Too often we overlook the one closest to the application, should I use an MVVM Framework? During this talk, we will discuss solving for team complexity, increasing velocity, and automate testing of your Xamarin project by adding MVMM to the mix.  We'll discuss common patterns and good practices around MVVM and Xamarin for a large scale enterprise solution!
