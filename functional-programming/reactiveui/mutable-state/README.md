# Taming Mutable State using ReactiveUI

## Abstract

As application developers, most of our concerns usually boil down to mutable state.  We have UI elements to update based on multiple properties changing in our ViewModel, and often times we mutate that state ourselves.  The purpose of this talk is to explore mutable state as a concept, and show developers a new way to react to state mutations and handle them in a declarative and composable manner.
