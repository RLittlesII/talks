# Go Reactive with Reactive Extensions and ReactiveUI

## Abstract
Mobile developers have some unique constraints that we have to solve for.  We develop in a world where we respond to events, fire asynchronous tasks all on a device that may not have the resources available to complete these tasks.  This talk will show you why you want to use Reactive Extensions and ReactiveUI to solve some of those concerns in a declarative manner, that makes it easier for you to focus on business value, rather than technical debt.
