## Abstract

Going out on the town? Need to run errands? Have to get groceries? You may need to go stand in line at your favorite or least favorite activities. These days it's better to play it safe. With establishments adhering to capacity rules for social distancing, it would be nice to put yourself in a virtual line as opposed to a physical one.

Enter SocialQ!

During this talk, we will walk through the architecture of an application designed for Social Distance Queuing. We will see how a user can queue for an establishment, receive notifications when appointment times are close, and navigate through establishments for a day out on the town. Everything is built with ReactiveUI and functional programming. We'll get a chance to see how ReactiveUI can be used as an MVVM framework to build an in-depth real world.
